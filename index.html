        Most solutions collected today can be mined for big, large, wide, fast, complex or real time data, depending on the business. However these bring with it common challenges in areas of analysis, capture, curation, search, sharing, storage, transfer, visualization, querying, updating and information privacy and security. Addressing these challenges at scale of data, required us to invest in specialized tools, innovative approaches, techniques like machine learning to help our clients use data beyond descriptive to predictive action.
